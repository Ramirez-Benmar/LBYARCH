x86-to-C interface programming project

# Requirements

Write the kernel in (1) C program and (2) an x86-64 assembly language.  The kernel is to perform a dot product between vector A and vector B and place the result in sdot.

Input: Scalar variable n (integer) contains the length of the vector;  Vectors A and B are both double-precision float. Scalar sdot is a double-precision float.

Output: store the result in memory location sdot.  Display the result for all versions of the kernel (i.e., C and  x86-64).
